# TODO

## Actions

* Calculate score.
* Show scores at end.

## Delight

* Organize tiles in factories and groups.
* Highlight/animate tile counters when they change.
* Random rotations for tiles.
* Deselect current player while in scoring phase.

## Refactors

* Flowtype for actions hard-typed
* Can't be wrong in floor placement - always for current player.
* Followup dispatch.
* Error fallback flow type crap.
* More Immutable helpers.
* Flow type checking better for context.
* Generic game provider.
* Organizer actions, models, index, provider etc.

## Logic

* Make sure you can pick -1 tile and put it in floor right away.
* Make sure anything you put in floor beyond goes to box.
* Make sure first tile is selected with leftovers.

## Next Phase

* Make it an SDK.
* UI for picking seed / players.
* Responsive design - mobile.
* Multiplier.
* AI.
