# TODO

- Arrange flow for initializing tracking and multi.
- Sometimes scoring floater/animations are not shown.
- CSS condition helper class.
- Audio delay in mobile?
- Mark game end when someone closes a row.
- Random AI.
- More analytics.
- Game end animation.
- Start game / end / restart UI.
- Fade out animation for staging row tiles.
- Responsive design - mobile.
- Extra validations and TODOs.
- Manual resolve - right API? probably need to have a promise that says "waiting for" and provides a thing.
- Present winning conditions better (rows tie, score)
- Followup dispatch is weird. Get rid of it?
- Solve 'will-change' and zIndex for tiles.
- Tiles out of placement / factory animation.
- Better bonus scoring effect.
- Animation speed for scoring as well.
- Better noise reduction on sounds.
- Add `immer`.
- Optional chaining.
- Separate game provider from dispatcher + generic game provider.
- Flowtype for actions hard-typed.
- Can't be wrong in floor placement - always for current player.
- Error fallback flow type crap (Because of & misuse)
- Cursor pointer on whole stagingrow/floor rather than placements.
- Organizer actions, models, index, provider etc.
- Player Board animator children flowtype.
- Log action if it's valid, but before it's committed.
- Make it an SDK.
- AI.
- Tile transition from places in the window.
