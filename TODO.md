# TODO

## Prioritized

* Sometimes scoring floater/animations are not shown.
* Audio delay in mobile?
* Game end.
* Random AI.
* More analytics.
* Cursor pointer on whole stagingrow/floor rather than placements.
* Start game / end / restart UI.
* Fade out animation for staging row tiles.
* Responsive design - mobile.
* Extra validations and TODOs.
* Manual resolve - right API? probably need to have a promise that says "waiting for" and provides a thing.
* Followup dispatch is weird. Get rid of it?
* Tiles out of placement / factory animation.
* Better bonus scoring effect.
* Animation speed for scoring as well.
* Better noise reduction on sounds.
* Add `immer`.
* Separate game provider from dispatcher.
* Flowtype for actions hard-typed.
* Can't be wrong in floor placement - always for current player.
* Error fallback flow type crap (Because of & misuse)
* Flow type checking better for context.
* Generic game provider.
* Organizer actions, models, index, provider etc.
* Player Board animator children flowtype.
* Log action if it's valid, but before it's committed.
* Make it an SDK.
* AI.
* Tile transition from places in the window.
